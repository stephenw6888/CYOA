You finally made it to the sand wall and then the Marine Commander shout "YOU BOY! I NEED YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR THE GERMAN UP AHEAD!" You followed the order and you peek out of the sand wall. You see a German Nest shooting down at your location. You realized that the position was tough for you to move up but you have two option:
